# Wilmar Malherbe

I dabble in the art of what is called "programming." Really don't enjoy it sometimes, but I just pop a monster and it's all good.

## About Me

I build web apps with Express on the NodeJS runtime, I make Discord bots that interface with weird Roblox games, and I also work on React projects. I prefer using MongoDB above any other database, since it's cool. What else is there, I'm a normal 16 year old that does a bit of typing, I mean it really isn't special lmao, the internet and YouTube exists, as long as you can understand docs you're set
