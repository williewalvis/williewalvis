## Useless Information

I build web apps with Express on the NodeJS runtime, I make Discord bots that interface with weird Roblox games, and I also work on React projects. I prefer using MongoDB above any other database, since it's cool. What else is there, I'm an average 16 year old that does a bit of typing, I mean it really isn't special lmao, the internet and YouTube exists, as long as you can understand docs you're set
