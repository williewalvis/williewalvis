# Wilmar Malherbe

I dabble in the art of what is called "programming." Really don't enjoy it sometimes, but I just pop a monster and it's all good.

## About Me

I primarily build web apps with Express in NodeJs, but I also work on React projects. I prefer using MongoDB above any other database, since it's cool. What else is there, I'm a normal 16 year old that does a bit of coding here and there.
